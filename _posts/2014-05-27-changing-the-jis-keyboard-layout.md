My MacBook Air comes with a Japanese keyboard whose default layout is called [JIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#Japanese). The price of this Japanese model was good and I confirmed that only some non-charactor keys are different from the standard English keyboard and it would perfectly work with most Chinese input method. Well, it turns out that I did not think it through... The keyboard issue started to bother me since I began to learn Python. The `:`, `"`, `Ôºù`, `+`, `-`, `( )`, `[ ]` positions are changed which are probably the most common used keys in writing Python. So I change the layout to a standard-closed one.

I used a keyboard layout editor named [*Ukelele*](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele). The layout is like this:

![default]({{ site.url }}/image/defaultlayout.jpg)

With the `shift` key being pressed:

![shift]({{ site.url }}/image/shiftdefaultlayout.jpg)

Ukelele is easy to use. Double click any key and input the wanted key layout in the pop-up window. Or you can drag the existed key to any other position. Boom, there you go.
